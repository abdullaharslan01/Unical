# ðŸŽ“ Unical: Your Best FriendðŸ”¬

This project came to mind while learning about the Slider component. With the help of this project, you can quickly and conveniently learn your midterm and final exam grades. I developed this project to swiftly calculate my own grades, but I'm sharing it because I believe it could be useful for you as well. You're free to enhance the project according to your preferences.

The program accomplishes the following functionalities:

1. You start by entering your midterm grade, followed by setting the passing grade for the course. The project promptly provides you with the minimum score required to pass the course based on the final exam.

2. When you input both your midterm and final exam grades, the program informs you about the average grade you achieved for the course. (The passing grade is set as 60 by default, but you can add it if needed.)
